# Notes: This nav will be developed to display cells on hover, decluttering the page yet offering multiple options to users. A search feature may be implemented for topic filtering. I plan to use a simple color palette in a monochromatic style with possible gradients and rounded corners. This is all subjective at this point as this development is in its beginning stages.
